# TESTING NOTES:
- Test with different walk patterns (circles, squares, complex shapes)
- Test with multiple users on same device
- Test with poor GPS conditions
- Test with long walks (>1 hour)
- Test with very short walks
- Test territory capture in different areas
- Test conflict scenarios with overlapping territories

# SCORING GUIDE:
- 0: Feature completely broken or missing
- 0.5: Feature partially works with issues
- 1: Feature works perfectly as intended

# TOTAL SCORE: ___/100
